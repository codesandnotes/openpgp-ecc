# openpgp-ecc

Some crude but functional example code on leveraging OpenPGP.js to work with EC cryptography.

Run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies. 
From there you can simply type `npm start` to start an *http-server* to access the main page. 

This code is meant as an illustration to this blog post about [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://www.codesandnotes.be/2019/06/11/elliptic-curve-cryptography-with-openpgp-js/) (available on June 11, 2019).
